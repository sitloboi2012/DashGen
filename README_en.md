## Introduce about DashGen

DashGen is an application that automates the creation and design of dashboards for data analysis tasks,
supporting individuals and businesses to optimize the time it takes to fully design an analytics dashboard in the fastest possible time.
This allows more time to be spent on finding insights and enhancing faster decision-making capabilities.

Unlike current applications that support the creation and design of dashboards,
DashGen aims to develop an application capable of creating a complete dashboard with many different aspects,
carefully considering the essential characteristics needed for an optimal dashboard such as aesthetics, logic, storytelling ability, connectivity,
and the capability to deliver business needs.

DashGen is a community project and is currently laying the basic foundations to develop into an open-source code with
contributions from developers and analysts in the future.
Moreover, DashGen is also exploring a direction of the Large Language Model (LLM)
that the Generative AI community is extremely interested in lately, namely Multi-Modal LLM (combining Text and Image).

## Project Progress

Currently, DashGen is in the preliminary planning process as well as beginning to evaluate and develop a Proof-of-Concept (PoC).
DashGen is currently focusing on using existing models and supporting Multi-Modal ones like GPT-4-Turbo,
and will expand the number of models in the future.

The development process of each phase will be released as soon as possible.
